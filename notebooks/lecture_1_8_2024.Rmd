# Elementary R

Examples of creating scalar variables and combining them:

```{r}
x=5
y=3
z = x+y
print(z)
```

```{r}
z
```

Strings are also possible:

```{r}
data_name = "day one example"
print(data_name)
```

# Arrays

Arrays are constructed using `c` for *combine*:

```{r}
data = c(1,2,3)
print(data)
```

```{r}
data_names = c("age", "height", "weight")
print(data_names)
```

Access elements with brackets:

```{r}
data[1]
```

```{r}
data_names[2]
```

Whole array operations are possible with numeric data:

```{r}
x=c(1., 2., 3.)
y=c(4., -2.4, 3.8)
```

```{r}
x+y
```

```{r}
x*y
```

Arrays of uniformly spaced elements:

```{r}
seq(0,1)
```

```{r}
seq(0,1,length=11)
```

eleven uniformly spaced points from 0 to 1, inclusive

```{r}
x = seq(0,1,length=11)
```

```{r}
y = sin(x)
y
```
